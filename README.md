- Slideshow application (Programming in Graphical Environment)

- Image processing filters (Computer Graphics)

## Getting Started

To run these projects, you will need a C# development environment such as Visual Studio. Clone this repository to your local machine, open the project in your preferred C# IDE, and build and run the project.
